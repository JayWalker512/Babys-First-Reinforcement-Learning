    "**Reinforcement learning (RL)** is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning)\n",

    "We will begin by exploring an old idea known as a **Markov Decision Process** (MDP). MDP's can be applied in reinforcement learning contexts, but as we will see they have limitations. If time allows, we will also explore **Deep Reinforcement Learning** which is a collection of newer techniques designed to overcome the limitations of MDP's by using **Neural Networks**."
