Baby's First Reinforcement Learning
-----------------------------------

This was my final project for my "Intro to Data Science" course at Temple University. For full details about this project, please [read the paper](BabysFirstReinforcementLearningPaper.pdf). 

You run the [Baby's First Reinforcement Learning Jupyter Notebook](BabysFirstReinforcementLearning.ipynb) to see the interesting stuff. The easiest way to do this is from an Anaconda3 environment with PyTorch installed.
